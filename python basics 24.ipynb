    "1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: def statement is used to create a normal function. where as lamba expressions are used to create Anonymous functions. which can be assigned to a variable and can be called using the variable later in function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda's body is a single expression and not a block of statements like def statement. The lambda expression's body is similar to what we'd put in a def body's return statement. We simply type the result as an expression instead of explicitly returning it. Because it is limited to an expression, a lambda is less general than a def statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the benefit of lambda?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The following are some of the benefits of lambda expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Can be used to create Nameless/Anonymous functions inside some complex functions if we are planning to use it only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Moderate to small functions can be created in a single line\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Fuctions created using lambda expressions can be assigned to a variable and can be used by simply calling the variable\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compare and contrast map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The differences between map, filter and reduce are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.map(): The map() function is a type of higher-order. This function takes another function as a parameter\n",
    "along with a sequence of iterables and returns an output after applying the function to each iterable present in the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. filter(): The filter() function is used to create an output list consisting of values for which the function returns true. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. reduce(): The reduce() function, as the name describes, applies a given function to the iterables and returns a single value"

    "4. What are function annotations, and how are they used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Function annotations provide a way of associating various parts of a function with arbitrary pythoncexpressions at compile time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Annotations of simple parameters def func(x: expression, y: expression = 20):\n",

    "5. What are recursive functions, and how are they used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: A recursive function is a function that calls itself during its execution. The process may repeat several times, outputting the result and the end of each iteration.\n",

    "Ans: Some of the general design guidelines for coding functions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Always use a docstring to explain the functionality of the function\n",
    "\n",
    "2.avoid using or limited use of global variables\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Proper Identation to increase the code readability\n",
    "\n",
    "4.try to follow a naming convention for function names (pascalCase or camelCase) and stick with the same convention throughout the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Avoid using digits while choosing a variable name\n",
    "\n",
    "6.try to use a name for the function which conveys the purpose of the function\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Local variables should be named using camelCase format (ex: localVariable) whereas Global variables names should be using PascalCase (ex:GlobalVariable).\n",
    "\n",
    "8.Constant should be represented in allcaps (ex:CONSTANT).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Name three or more ways that functions can communicate results to a caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Some of the ways in which a function can communicate with the calling function is:\n",

    "1.print\n",
    "2.return\n",
    "3.yield"
